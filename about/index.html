      <p class="intro">More About Me</p>
      <p class="bio">I’m a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Georgia with a professional focus in software development and full-stack web programming. I enjoy seeing my work turned into functional, well-crafted experiences.</p>
      <p class="bio2">On the side, I'm also especially passionate about game development and digital illustration, where I'm able to delve into the more colorful side of technology. I dream of bringing my own stories and worlds to life by combining my technical and creative skills together.</p>
      <p>If you are reading this right now, this website isn't finished yet because of my midterms. Check back in a week and I will defintely have it done by then.</p>
